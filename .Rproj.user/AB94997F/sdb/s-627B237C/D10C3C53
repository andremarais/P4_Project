Most wines have a **quality** rating of 5, with 75% of the wines having a rating of 6 or lower.

The minimum residual sugar level is 0.9, so all red wines contain at least some sugar\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = chlorides), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nThe chlorides data have a pretty long tail. Excluding the top 2.5% quantile again:\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = chlorides), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, as.numeric(quantile(rw$chlorides, .975))))\n```\n</br>\nBarring the outliers, the chloride levels are quite symmetric around `r round(mean(rw$chlorides[rw$chlorides < as.numeric(quantile(rw$chlorides,.975))]),3) `  (the mean for the data in the graph above)\n</br>\n\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nThere is a peak of free sulfur dioxide levels between 5 and 6. Sulfar dioxide is in general a bad thing in wine (affects the taste and some people are allergic to it). The peak of sulfur dioxide levels might be due to compliance by most wineries with food laws. \n</br>\n\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nTotal sulfar dioxide might not be that much more informative than the previous metric, since it's dependent on the amount of wine in the bottle (the taste might be more related to the previous metric as opposed to total sulfar dioxide levels)\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\n  ggplot(rw) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(x = density), \n                   col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                   fill = 'dodgerblue1',\n                   position = 'dodge') +\n    plot.theme\n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = pH), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nThe density and pH histograms look like they might come from a normal distribution. Surprisingly, the Shapiro test for normality show that they don't. The p-value for the Shapiro test for both of these metrics are far less than 0.05. The null hypothesis for the Spapiro states that the values come from a normal distribution, while the alternative is that the values do _not_ come from a normal distribution. With a p-value of less than 0.05 we can reject that null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The p-value for density: `r formatC(shapiro.test(rw$density)$p.value,digits=10,format=\"f\")` and for pH: `r formatC(shapiro.test(rw$pH)$p.value,digits=10,format=\"f\")`\n</br>\n\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = sulphates), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nSulphates also has a very long tail. Excluding the top 2.5% quantile again:\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = sulphates), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, as.numeric(quantile(rw$sulphates, .975))))\n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = alcohol), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nIt looks like there is always at least some alcohol and sulphites in  wine. The minimum quantity of alcohol found is `r min(rw$alcohol)` and for sulphates `r min(rw$sulphates)` It seems like sulphatis is the go-to preservative for wine because of its antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Alcohol is a natural by-product of fermentation, so it shouldn't be a surprise. There is also a peak of alcohol content of \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = as.factor(quality)), \n                 col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                 fill = 'dodgerblue1') +\n    xlab('quality')+\n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nAs stated previously, it might be more meaningful to treat the quality values as factors. Without knowing what the possible range is like for the ratings (ie does it go from 1 to 10, or only from 3 to 6), it's difficult to say what these scores actually mean. I would assume a higher score is better. More than 96% of the wine has a rating of 5 or better. It will be interesting to see what makes the wines with a rating of 3 or 4 so bad. \n</br>\n\n### <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue;\">Univariate analysis </span>\n#### <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue;\">Data overview </span>\n</br>\nThe red wine data set has 1,599 data points, with 13 features (of which we can ignore one, namely **X**). All but one feature are numeric values - **quality** was converted to factors. Only a few features are easy to judge in terms of scale (ie is lower better?). \n</br>\n</br>\nA few things I found interesting were the peak values for some features, which _might_ be due to legislation in some countries. Feature like **free sulfar dioxide**, **pH** and **alcohol** have definate peaks. While it's not possible to determine whether it really is due to legislation or just coincidental, it will be interesting to see if it has an effect on the wine itself. I created three new dummy variables to indicate whether the wine is above (1) or beneath (0) the peak value for **free sulfar dioxide**, **pH** and **alcohol** individually. The peak values for these values are `r names(table(rw$free.sulfur.dioxide))[order(table(rw$free.sulfur.dioxide), decreasing = T)[1]]`, `r names(table(rw$pH))[order(table(rw$pH), decreasing = T)[1]]` and `r names(table(rw$alcohol))[order(table(rw$alcohol), decreasing = T)[1]]` respectively.\n</br>\n</br>\nI'm curious to see how the sulphate and alcohol levels affect the quality of the wine. Citric accid and sugar content might boil down to personal preference, but I'll investigat the relation between those variables and the quality of the wine just the same. \n</br>\n</br>\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue;\">Bivariate Plots</span>\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, }\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\n### function to create dummy variables \ndv.function <- function(x) {\n  sapply(x, function(y) \n    if (y > (x %>% table %>% names %>% as.numeric)\n        [(x %>% table %>% order(decreasing = T))[1]]) 1 else 0)\n}\n\nrw$free.sulfur.dioxide.dv <- dv.function(rw$free.sulfur.dioxide)\nrw$ph.dv <- dv.function(rw$pH)\nrw$alcohol.dv <- dv.function(rw$alcohol)\n\ncorrplot(cor(rw[ ,2:13]), type = 'lower')\n```\n</br>\nA larger more opaque circle indicates a more significant correlation. Blue indicates a positive correlation while red indicates a negative correlation. From the graph above we can see it's worthwhile to look at the link between **alcohol** levels vs **quality** and **volatile acidity** vs quality. Other variables we can look at include **density** vs **alcohol** and **density** vs **fixed acidity**. It's interesting to note that the sulphate levels don't correlate much with non-sulphate features. \n</br>\n\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(quality), \n                              y = alcohol), \n                          outlier.colour ='firebrick1',\n                          col = 'dodgerblue3',\n                          fill = 'dodgerblue1') + \n  plot.theme + xlab('Quality') + \n  ggtitle('Quality vs Alcohol')\n```\n</br>\nNote the amount of outliers (red dots) for wine which has a quality rating of 5. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(quality), \n                              y = sulphates), \n                          outlier.colour ='firebrick1',\n                          col = 'dodgerblue3',\n                          fill = 'dodgerblue1') + \n  plot.theme + xlab('Quality') + \n  ggtitle('Quality vs Alcohol')\n```\n</br>\nOnce again a lot of outliers with wine which has a quality rating of 5.\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(quality),\n                              y = volatile.acidity), \n                          outlier.colour ='firebrick1',\n                          col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                          fill = 'dodgerblue1') + \n  plot.theme + xlab('Quality') + \n  ggtitle('Quality vs Volatile acidity')\n```\n</br>\nAnd again, there seems to be quite a few outliers with higher quality wines. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(quality),\n                              y = density), \n                          outlier.colour ='firebrick1',\n                          col = 'dodgerblue3', \n                          fill = 'dodgerblue1') + \n  plot.theme + xlab('Quality') + \n  ggtitle('Quality vs Volatile acidity')\n```\n</br>\nNo clear link between quality and density.\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\n\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = density, \n                 y = alcohol),\n             col = 'dodgerblue3') + \n  plot.theme + \n  ggtitle('Density vs alcohol') +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = density, y = alcohol), \n              method = \"lm\", \n              se = F, \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1) \n```\n</br>\nThe straight line is regression line, the descending slope shows the negative correlation. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = density, \n                 y = fixed.acidity),\n             col = 'dodgerblue3') + \n  plot.theme + \n  ggtitle('Density vs fixed acidity') +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = density, \n                  y = fixed.acidity), \n              method = \"lm\", \n              se = F, \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1) \n```\n</br>\nIn this case the ascending regression line show the positive correlation between the density and fixed acidity of red wine. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = pH, \n                 y = fixed.acidity),\n             col = 'dodgerblue3') + \n  plot.theme + \n  ggtitle('pH vs fixed acidity') +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = pH, y = \n                    fixed.acidity), \n              method = \"lm\", \n              se = F, \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1) \n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = pH, y = citric.acid),\n             col = 'dodgerblue3') + \n  plot.theme + \n  ggtitle('pH vs citric acid') +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = pH, \n                  y = citric.acid), \n              method = \"lm\", \n              se = F, \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(rw$citric.acid)))\n```\n</br>\n\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue;\">Bivariate analysis</span>\n</br> \nThe quality of the wine increases along with higher alcohol content and lower volatile acidity levels. There are quite a few alcohol outliers with wines having a quality rating of 5. _If_ 5 is the average rating for wine, it wouldn't be too naive to assume that a rating of 5 is the go-to rating for wines where the judge can't place it with confidence. This might be the reason why there is a higher variance with the wine with a rating of 5. Also, higher quality wine have smaller volatile acidity levels. Another thing I found interesting is that the variance of the alcohol content increases with the quality of the wine, while the variance of the volatile acidity decreases with better quality wine. This might be due to the wine makers being slightly indifferent about the alcohol content with their wines, and being more concerned about _making a good wine._\n\nUsing a random forest model, you can see what the important variables are to help predict quality. Using 500 trees, with replacement, the top 6 features are as follows:\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F, cache=T}\nrf.Imp <-randomForest(as.factor(quality) ~ . , data = rw[ ,2:13])\n\ngsub('\\\\.', ' ',row.names(rf.Imp$importance))[order(rf.Imp$importance, decreasing = T)][1:6]\n```\n</br>\nThe random forest itself: \n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F, cache=T}\nrf.Imp\n```\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue;\">Multivariate plots</span>\n\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = alcohol, \n                 y = volatile.acidity), \n             col = 'dodgerblue1') + \n  facet_grid(.~quality) + \n  plot.theme\n```\n</br>\nIt looks the alcohol variance is much lower with lower quality wines. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\ntapply(rw$alcohol, rw$quality, summary)\n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\naggregate(data = rw, alcohol ~ quality, FUN = var)\n```\n</br>\nThe variance in fact higer with the better quality wines. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\naggregate(data = rw, alcohol ~ quality, FUN = var) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = quality, \n                y = alcohol), \n            col = 'dodgerblue3',\n            alpha = .25)+\n    geom_point(aes(x = quality, \n                y = alcohol), \n            col = 'dodgerblue3')+\n  plot.theme +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = quality, \n                  y = alcohol), \n              se = F, \n              method = 'lm', \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1)\n```\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\ntapply(rw$volatile.acidity, rw$quality, summary)\n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\naggregate(data = rw, volatile.acidity ~ quality, FUN = var)\n```\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\naggregate(data = rw, volatile.acidity ~ quality, FUN = var) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = quality, \n                y = volatile.acidity), \n            col = 'dodgerblue3',\n            alpha = .25)+\n    geom_point(aes(x = quality, \n                y = volatile.acidity), \n            col = 'dodgerblue3')+\n  plot.theme +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = quality, y = volatile.acidity), \n              se = F, \n              method = 'lm', \n              col = 'firebrick1', \n              size = 1)\n```\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\nggplot(rw) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = density, \n                 y = total.sulfur.dioxide, \n                 col = as.factor(alcohol.dv)),\n                 alpha = .35) + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"dodgerblue1\", \"firebrick1\")) + \n  facet_grid(quality ~.) + \n  plot.theme + \n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n```\n</br>\nBlue dots refer to wines with an alcohol level beneath the mode, while red dots are for wines with an alcohol level above the mode. \nThe two outliers in the second last plot shrinks the results too much, taking then out...\n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\n# indenting with magrittr is still tricky\nrw %>%\nsubset(rw %$%\n         total.sulfur.dioxide < rw %$% \n         total.sulfur.dioxide %>% \n         quantile(.975) %>% \n         as.numeric) %>%\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = density, \n                 y = total.sulfur.dioxide, \n                 col = as.factor(alcohol.dv)),\n             alpha = .35) + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"dodgerblue1\", \"firebrick1\")) + \n  facet_grid(quality ~.) + \n  plot.theme + \n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n```\n</br>\nCan't say much regarding the split between red and blue dots. \n</br>\n```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=F}\n\nrw %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = chlorides, \n                 y = sulphates, \n                 col = as.factor(ph.dv)),\n             alpha = .35) + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"dodgerblue1\", \"firebrick1\")) + \n  facet_grid(quality ~.) + \n  plot.theme + \n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n```\n</br>\nRemoving the chlorine outliers.
